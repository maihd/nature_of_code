# Introduction
This folder contains excersises and examples from Nature of Code book. I convert theses to katas, and use for practice creativing coding daily.

## Kata list
- Introduction
    - Random walk
    - Random walk 8 directions
    - Random walk with gaussian
    - Random walk with probability
    - Normal distribution

## How to do kata
- Read and understand the problem give by kata
- Solve the problem in paper/note/mind
- Choose language/framework to solve this with computer
    - p5js: easiest way, just create new js file, open live-p5 panel
    - raylib: create new .c file, add entry to scripts/genie.lua, generate project with genie
- See the result, if satisfied remove the file
- Repeat daily

## Advises
- Enjoy practice programming
- Kata should takes short time to finish
- No pressures when practicing
- It should fun and motivate
- Be creative, try multiways:
    - Try other paradigm: oop, functional, procedure, dod,...
    - Try other framework: raylib, p5js, elm-canvas, elm-p5, processing, DIY framework,...
    - Try other language: js, c/c++, elm, java, kotlin, python, lua,...
- Reading this again when you start new practice session, day after day.
